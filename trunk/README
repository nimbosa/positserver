Before starting to modify and all. I want to keep some stuffs clear. 

Dependencies:

python 2.5 - I am using it on my server and I'm assuming its the same. Else, modify to any other version. I'm completely sure I'll not downgrade this for any reason
django 0.96.2 - As of July 1, 2008
python-sqlite2 
sqlite3


Run the application using 
./runserver.sh
-- runs both the django application and the xmlrpc one.
or individually with
./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8081
for the django server
skip the 0.0.0.0:8081 part. It's only if you are exposing it to internet.

xmlrpc/pythonxml.py
for the xmlrpc server.
I'll add some more functionality to this later.

Also, remember to change the name of the folder to positServer or change everywhere to positserver.
